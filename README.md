**Concept Breakdown Tool**<br>
Comprehensive Java-based application designed to help students, professors, and educators organize, visualize, and manage information. It's purpose is to assist visual-spatial learners in breaking down concepts into a more digestible format so that students can have a better grasp of subjects, faciliate the identification of relationships among concepts, and properly communicate these ideas.

**Functionality**
- <ins>Concept Management:</ins> Users can add, update, and delete concepts, each associated with unique identifiers, names, categories, and a detailed description.
- <ins>Component Association:</ins> For each concept, users can attach multiple components, representing an element or idea that makes up that concept.
- <ins>Category Classification:</ins> Concepts grouped into categories, enabling users to classify information into broader thematic areas.
- <ins>Data Persistence:</ins> Offers capabilities to load and save the structured data to and from a JSON file, ensuring that information is preserved between sessions and can be shared or distributed.
- <ins>Visualization Recommendations:</ins> Using a set of predefined diagram types to help students graphically organize and present their concepts.

**Usage Scenarios**
- <ins>Educational Settings:</ins> Educators can use the Concept Breakdown Tool to outline course materials, break down complex subjects into tasks that are easier for students to understand.
- <ins>Project Planning:</ins> Professionals can use the Concept Breakdown Tool to outline project scopes, tasks, and activities in order to have a clear understanding among employees and stakeholders.
- <ins>Knowledge Sharing:</ins> For Students who share information on a particular topic, Concept Breakdown Tool offers a structured format for creating and disseminating information.

**Get Started**<br>
